Just a course work of practising I2I Translation.

2022.07-2022.08 

Participated in a workshop entitled Image Synthesis and Cross Domain Transfer: Breaking the Data Barrier in the Era of Deep Learning, which includes Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs), Image to Image(I2I) Translation, Composition based Image Synthesis, Image Editing and Image Inpainting, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Unsupervised Model Adaptation and Domain Generalization. 

Train a CycleGAN image translation model, to translate images from GTA5 to Cityscapes styles, tackle the CycleGAN constraints for better image translation models, and practise unsupervised domain adaptation via input-space alignment.
